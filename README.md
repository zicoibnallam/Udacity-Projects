This project has been converted from a static project to an interactive one,

After modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

There are 4 sections that have been added to the page.

Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.

When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link will scroll to the appropriate section.

Styling has been added for active states.

It is obvious which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
